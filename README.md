# Predicting-Employee-Attrition-at-Sailfort-Motors-A-Data-Driven-HR-Analysis

**Employee Attrition Prediction at Sailfort Motors**

This is a data analytics project focused on predicting employee attrition and providing data-driven insights for the Human Resources (HR) department at Sailfort Motors, a prominent consulting firm. The project aims to identify factors that contribute to employee turnover and offer recommendations to improve employee satisfaction and retention.

**Business Problem and Goals:**
The HR department at Sailfort Motors collected employee data but lacked a clear understanding of how to leverage it effectively. The primary question to address is: What factors are likely to make an employee leave the company? By predicting employees who may quit, the company can proactively identify and address issues leading to attrition, ultimately reducing recruitment costs and enhancing overall employee retention.

**Approach and Methodology:**
The project follows a structured approach to analyze the dataset and build predictive models. The key steps include:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Thoroughly examined the dataset, performed data cleaning, and visualized various features to gain insights into the employee dynamics and identify potential patterns.
- Logistic Regression (1st Approach): Developed a logistic regression model to predict employee attrition. Achieved an accuracy of 83% and obtained precision, recall, and F1-score of 80%, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in identifying employees likely to leave.
- Decision Tree and Random Forest (2nd Approach - Part 1): Employed decision tree and random forest algorithms to improve prediction performance. Achieved high accuracy and other evaluation metrics, with an AUC of 0.954 for the random forest model on the validation set.
- Decision Tree and Random Forest (2nd Approach - Part 2): Expanded on the previous approach by fine-tuning the decision tree and random forest models. Achieved an AUC of 0.942 for the decision tree and 0.933 for the random forest on the validation set, indicating robust predictive capabilities.

**Results and Impact:**
The developed models provide valuable insights into employee attrition patterns at Sailfort Motors. By leveraging these models, the HR department can proactively identify employees who may be at risk of leaving and take necessary measures to address their concerns. This proactive approach not only enhances employee satisfaction and engagement but also reduces recruitment and training costs associated with high turnover.
